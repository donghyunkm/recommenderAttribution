### Introduction

TracIn computes the influence of a training instance on a prediction made by the model. The method estimates the change in test loss when the training instance of interest is used to update model weights [@pruthi2020estimating].

### Limitations and future work

To achieve meaningful performance gains, a non trivial amount of data has to be removed. 

Thus, for some items, the recommender system is unable to learn meaningful relationships with user history.
